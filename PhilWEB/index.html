<div id= "about"> <h1> About Me:</h1> Hi, my name is Phil! I am a third year Communications student majoring in marketing and minoring in media at Mssey University. Designing this website has been an absolutle learning curve, but this is exactly why i decided to do it. <br> I have 0 experience with photoshop let alone coding! But it seems to be a very useful skill. All my studies so far have been 90% theoretical. The three pictures above is part of the 10% of some form of design, this was for my PR class in 2019 in which we were creating for VSA( Volunteer Service Abroad), avenues in which their organisation could explore in order to attract more of their target audience to volunteer for them. This is a selcetion of three advertsing campaigns i created with some online eitor as i dont have photoshop haha. Below you will find pictures about what i do as a part-time job and some of my hobbies as im sure you dont want to read my bussiness eassys so lets look at some pictures instead!

    <div id= "work"> MY PART-TIME JOB!</div>

        <div div class="col"><a data-fancybox="gallery"href="Orange1.png"><img src="Orange1.png" height= 400/></a></div>

    <div class="job"> <p> Aside from being a Uni student,  I work part-time as a bartender/ mixologist at southern cross garden bar of which i have worked for over a year now. Pictured above is a simple but delcious citrus cocktail I made for my family whilst on holiday in South Africa. The drink consists of orange juice, lemon, brown sugar, bitters, gin, and an orange peel, PERFECT FOR SUMMER! <br> I find making cocktails fun and take care in making them look aesthetically pleasing. </p></div>
    
    <div id= "HOBBY"> ONE OF MY HOBBIES </div>
    <div id= "DJ"><a data-fancybox="gallery"href="DJ.JPG"><img src= "DJ_small.png"></a></div>
     <div class= "hobbyp"> <p> One of my more recent hobbies has been this bad boi pictured above. This is my DDJ400 mixing deck of which i remix house muscic with! I do this purely in my free time as i always love finding new music and adding them into a mix where i can just groove for however many hours. Just like this website, leearning all the features of mixing music has been a learning curve, ive watched a lot ofonline classes and videos on different ways totransition, crossfade add effects  and beats, creating this whole unique sound. its really quite cool and a fun pass time of mine. Who doesnt enjoy music? </p></div>
    
    <div id= "set"> 
        <div class="col"><a data-fancybox="gallery"href="set2.JPG"><img src="set2_small.png"/></a></div>
        <div class="col"><a data-fancybox="gallery"href="set1.JPG"><img src="set1_small.png"/></a></div>
    
    </div>
    <div class= "setp"> Finally the two pictures above are some photographs I took at a music gig with one of my favourite people who ive ever worked with, who also happens to be a dj who taught me alot of what i know and introduced me to the idea of doing it as a hobby in the first place. He's from melbourne and has 15 years in djing at events, funnily enough he was originally my Duty Manager at Southern Cross Garden Bar. We just happened to have similar music taste and clicked over that. He ahs since left to wales with his fiance. This night is a memory i will cheerish for ever and thank him for giving me the experience and what he had taught me.</div>
